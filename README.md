# CS598_CC

These are the leads to efficiently navigate us through this project. Each member will lead one area:

1. Research and Development Lead (Apaar Bhatnagar):

- In charge of managing the project's overall development and making sure that its many components work together.
- Pay attention to comprehending the fundamental components of the Cypress and Hermod frameworks and how they can be used to great effect.
- Integrate the performance monitoring and optimization module with the scheduling policy engine.
- Make sure that the architecture is compatible with widely used serverless solutions by integrating it with them.



2. System Design and Implementation Lead (Abhishek Srikanth):

- In charge of creating the system's architecture and putting key components—such as the container management layer and the input size profiling module—into place.
- Put your attention on creating the input size profiling module and use empirical models to allocate resources according to input sizes.
- In order to dynamically allocate containers based on input size distributions and workload characteristics, design and build the container management layer.


3. Testing and Evaluation Lead (Yun Hui Xu):

- In charge of putting the system through testing and assessing its performance in relation to predetermined goals and criteria.
- Concentrate on establishing test settings in order to evaluate the integrated scheduling methodology's effectiveness.
- Keep an eye on critical performance metrics including throughput, function slowness, and cold start occurrences to make sure the system satisfies SLO and performance requirements.
- By assigning each team member a specific duty, the suggested system architecture will be developed, implemented, and evaluated, and each member will be responsible for a certain area of the project. Team members must collaborate and communicate on a regular basis to successfully integrate and finish the project.
