# CS598_CC

To efficiently divide the work for this project among three team members, the tasks can be distributed as follows:

1. Research and Development Lead (Apaar Bhatnagar):

Responsible for overseeing the overall project development and ensuring cohesion between different components.
Focus on understanding the essential elements of the Hermod and Cypress frameworks and how they can be effectively integrated.
Work on integrating the scheduling policy engine and the performance monitoring and optimization module.
Integrate the architecture with popular serverless systems, ensuring smooth interoperability.


2. System Design and Implementation Lead (Abhishek Srikanth):

Responsible for designing the system architecture and implementing the crucial parts, including the input size profiling module and the container management layer.
Focus on developing the input size profiling module by utilizing empirical models for resource allocation based on input sizes.
Design and implement the container management layer to dynamically distribute containers based on input size distributions and workload parameters.

3. Testing and Evaluation Lead (Yun Hui Xu):

Responsible for testing the system and evaluating its performance against predefined metrics and objectives.
Focus on setting up test environments for assessing the efficacy of the integrated scheduling methodology.
Monitor vital performance indicators such as function slowness, throughput, and instances of cold starts to ensure the system meets the performance and SLO requirements.
This distribution of tasks should ensure that each team member is responsible for a specific aspect of the project, contributing to the development, implementation, and evaluation of the suggested system architecture. Regular communication and collaboration between team members are crucial for successful integration and completion of the project.
